_Last updated: October 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how **PortIQ** (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and protects limited information when you use our application (the “App”).

---

### 1. Information We Collect
PortIQ is designed to minimize data collection.  
We may collect:
- The text you input into the App (“user story”) for the sole purpose of generating your output.
- Non-personal usage data such as timestamps, anonymized session identifiers, or error logs.

We **do not require or intentionally collect** names, email addresses, Social Security numbers, account numbers, or other personally identifiable information (“PII”).

---

### 2. How We Use Data
Collected data is used only to:
- Generate portfolios and educational reports;
- Improve reliability and performance of the App; and
- Ensure system security and prevent abuse.

We **do not sell, rent, or share** data with third parties for marketing or advertising.

---

### 3. Data Retention
Session data is temporarily stored in memory and may be logged anonymously for up to **30 days** for debugging or analytics.  
You may clear your session at any time using the “Delete my data” button.  
Older data is automatically deleted or anonymized.

---

### 4. Third-Party Services
PortIQ uses third-party APIs and libraries such as:
- **OpenAI API** for natural-language processing  
- **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)** for public market data

These services may process your input solely to return a result to you.  
Refer to their respective privacy policies for more information.

---

### 5. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data.  
However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

---

### 6. Your Rights
You may request deletion of session data or cessation of data use by contacting **privacy@portiq.ai**.  
Because we collect minimal information, we may not be able to identify individual records without additional context.

---

### 7. Children’s Privacy
PortIQ is not directed at or intended for use by individuals under 18 years of age.  
If we learn that we have unintentionally collected data from a minor, we will delete it promptly.

---

### 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.  
The updated version will be posted in the App with a revised “Last Updated” date.
